            <p> who we are </p>

            <p> the lakes is a collaborative project between
                independent artists, for independent artists. </p>
            <p> our goal is to provide other independent artists
                a platform in which they can make their art known
                to the world. Through collaborative effort,
                we strive to help the world uncover
                unknown talents. </p>
